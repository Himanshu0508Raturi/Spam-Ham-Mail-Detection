# Spam-Ham Mail Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at classifying emails as **spam** or **ham** (not spam). The project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and various machine learning algorithms to create an effective email classifier.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for email datasets
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques (e.g., Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF)
- Machine learning models for spam detection (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results and model performance

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshu0508Raturi/Spam-Ham-Mail-Detection.git
   cd Spam-Ham-Mail-Detection
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset:**  
   Ensure your dataset is in the correct format (e.g., CSV with columns for text and label).

2. **Run the main script:**  
   The main scripts/notebooks demonstrate training and evaluating the classifier.  
   Example:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Or open and run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Spam-Ham-Mail-Detection.ipynb
   ```

3. **View results:**  
   Model performance metrics and visualizations will be displayed in the notebook or as output files.


## Dataset

You may use public datasets or your own dataset formatted appropriately.

**Note:** Do not upload sensitive or personal email data to this repository.
